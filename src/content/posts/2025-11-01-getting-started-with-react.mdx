# Getting Started with React

This post walks through creating a React project, hooks basics, and modern tooling like Vite and Tailwind.

- Create app with `npm create vite@latest`
- Use `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for fast refresh

```tsx
import React from "react";
export default function Example() {
  return <div>Hello React</div>;
}
```
